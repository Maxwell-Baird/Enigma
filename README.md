I think I will get a 3 on Functionality because I created both the encrypt and decrypt methods and successfully implemented the command line interface
I think I will get a 3 on OOP because the enigma class is not to large and the class is broken down into logical methods
For Ruby conventions and mechanics I would lean towards a 4 because the methods are equal to 10 or less lines and the code is well named and is properly indented
For TDD I would give myself a 4 because simple coverage shows a 100% coverage and I used stubs to check my random generated key and to check the date.
For version control I would give myself a 4 because I have over 40 commits and did multiple pull request and the commit messages were clear in what they did.
